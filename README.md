# Data Science Project: Clustering Analysis and Interpretation

## Overview

This project involves performing a clustering analysis on a dataset using k-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) methods. The primary goal is to categorize countries based on various socio-economic indicators to identify those in most need of assistance. The analysis includes data preparation, clustering, interpretation, and recommendations for an non-govermental organization (NGO). The detailed info is in the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains socio-economic indicators for various countries, including metrics such as child mortality, GDP per capita, inflation, and more. The data is sourced from kaggle.com.

## Data Preparation

The initial step involves loading and cleaning the dataset, including handling missing values and normalizing features. This ensures the data is ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is conducted to understand the data distribution and relationships between features. Visualizations and summary statistics are used to identify patterns and anomalies.

## Feature Selection

Key features relevant for clustering are selected based on their significance and contribution to the analysis. This step involves assessing the impact of each feature on the clustering results.

## Clustering Analysis

##### k-Means Clustering

- **Silhouette Score**: The silhouette score is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for k-Means clustering.
- **Silhouette Plot**: Visual representation of cluster separation.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Evaluation of cluster characteristics and visualization of clustering results.

##### HAC Clustering

- **Dendrogram**: A hierarchical representation of clusters is generated using HAC.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Comparison of HAC results with k-Means and evaluation of cluster characteristics.

## Cluster Interpretation

##### k-Means Clustering Interpretation

- **Cluster Analysis**: Interpretation of each k-Means cluster based on socio-economic indicators.
- **Top Countries**: Identification of the top countries in need of assistance based on clustering results.

##### HAC Clustering Interpretation

- **Cluster Analysis**: Interpretation of HAC clusters and comparison with k-Means results.

## Conclusions and Future Work

- **Summary and Interpretation**: Summary of findings and their implications for the NGO.
- **Recommendation for the NGO**: Practical recommendations based on clustering results.
- **Future Work**: Suggestions for further analysis and improvements.
